// INTRODUCTION TO CONCURRENT SYSTEMS AND MULTITHREADING
// Concurrent system refers to systems where multiple tasks or computations appear to happen at the same time. 



// Multithreading: 
// It is a specific way to acheieve concurrency within a single program. Imagine that a single program is our chef , 
// Multithreading will allows the chef to have multiple hands , each capable of working on a part of a atask or different tasks independently but concurrently.



// Concurrency vs. Parallelism
// COncurrency is about dealing with multiple things at once. It can lead to Parallelism but doesn't have to. Think of one person juggling multiple balls.

// Parallelism is about doing multiple things at once , This requires hardware with multiple processing units. Thinks of multiple people juggling their own set of balls simultaneously. Multithreading on a multi core processor can achieve true parallelism.
